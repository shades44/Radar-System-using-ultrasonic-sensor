# Email Spam Detection Using Python.

Spam filters detect unsolicited, unwanted, and virus-infested emails (called spam) and stop them from getting into email inboxes. Internet Service Providers (ISPs) use spam filters to make sure they arenâ€™t distributing spam. 

Small to medium-sized businesses (SMBs) also use spam filters to protect their employees and networks.





## Steps

- Load and simplify the dataset.
- Summarize the data.
- Split the dataset.
- Apply Count Vectorizer for feature extraction.
- Train our SVM Model.
- Check out the accuracy, and f-measure.
- Using Test dataset messages check the output.



## Libraries

### sklearn
scikit-learn is an open-source Python library that implements a range of machine learning, pre-processing, cross-validation, and visualization algorithms using a unified interface.

### pandas
Pandas is a Python library used for working with data sets. It has functions for analyzing, cleaning, exploring, and manipulating data.


## Installation

Using pip

```bash
  pip install sklearn
```
